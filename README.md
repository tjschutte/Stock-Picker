# Stock-Picker
NOTE, large portions of code borrowed from a num.py demo page.

Took some example code and ran several stocks through it and used some common bench marks to make a suggestion about buying and selling stock. By no means is this app full proof, and by no means should it be used to make financial decisions. Use at own risk.
